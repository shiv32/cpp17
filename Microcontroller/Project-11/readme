/*
Finding Out The C++ Compiler Version Arduino

You can determine which C++ standard is in use for you board by uploading this sketch and then opening Serial Monitor at 9600 baud:
----------------------------------------------------
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while(!Serial){}
  Serial.println(__cplusplus);
}

void loop() {}
----------------------------------------------------
__cplusplus

This macro is defined when the C++ compiler is in use. 
You can use __cplusplus to test whether a header is compiled by a C compiler or a C++ compiler. This macro is similar to STDC_VERSION, in that it expands to a version number. Depending on the language standard selected, the value of the macro is 199711L for the 1998 C++ standard, 201103L for the 2011 C++ standard, 201402L for the 2014 C++ standard, 201703L for the 2017 C++ standard, or an unspecified value strictly larger than 201703L for the experimental languages enabled by -std=c++2a and -std=gnu++2a.
