The Real Overhead of Dynamic Polymorphism
Pure Virtual and Abstract

-------------------------------
In general English

"Abstract" = existing in thought or as an idea, not in concrete/physical form.
Example: “Freedom” is an abstract concept.

In OOP, abstract = incomplete blueprint.
It defines what derived classes must implement, but not how.
-------------------------------

Interface class = abstract class only pure virtual methods, typically no data, no implemented methods.

Abstract class  = can mix pure virtual, virtual-with-default, and even fully implemented methods and data members.
