/*

 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in C++ is commonly used to control the power delivered to devices 
 such as motors, LEDs, or servos by varying the duty cycle of a signal. 
 Many microcontrollers, such as Arduino, have built-in functions to work with PWM.

 To simulate PWM on a desktop system using C++, we can't directly generate a PWM signal like we can on microcontrollers.
 However, we can simulate the behavior of PWM by printing output to the console, where we vary the duty cycle over time. 
 You can simulate this by using a time loop and adjusting the "pulse" with delays, similar to how PWM works.
