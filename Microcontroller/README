Fixed-Width Integer Types (from <cstdint> or <stdint.h>):
These are especially important in embedded systems to ensure precise control over the size of variables:

int8_t, uint8_t: 8-bit signed and unsigned integers.
int16_t, uint16_t: 16-bit signed and unsigned integers.
int32_t, uint32_t: 32-bit signed and unsigned integers.
int64_t, uint64_t: 64-bit signed and unsigned integers (used sparingly on smaller microcontrollers).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UINT8_C is a macro defined in the C and C++ standard libraries, typically found in <cstdint> (C++) or <stdint.h> (C). 
It is used to define a constant of type uint8_t (an unsigned 8-bit integer).

The UINT8_C macro ensures that the literal constant is treated as a uint8_t type. 
This is particularly useful when working with fixed-width integer types across different platforms, 
where type sizes may vary.
