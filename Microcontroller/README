Microcontroller code using C++.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed-Width Integer Types (from <cstdint> or <stdint.h>):
These are especially important in embedded systems to ensure precise control over the size of variables:

int8_t, uint8_t: 8-bit signed and unsigned integers.
int16_t, uint16_t: 16-bit signed and unsigned integers.
int32_t, uint32_t: 32-bit signed and unsigned integers.
int64_t, uint64_t: 64-bit signed and unsigned integers (used sparingly on smaller microcontrollers).
