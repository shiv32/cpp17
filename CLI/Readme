CLI11 is used in industry, particularly in projects that require command-line tools or developer utilities in C++. 
It has been adopted in both open-source and proprietary software due to its:

Modern C++11+ design, which fits well with current C++ development practices.
Ease of integration, being header-only and lightweight.
Rich feature set, rivaling older libraries like Boost.Program_options, but with simpler syntax and better usability.

âœ… Notable Use Cases
Scientific computing tools: Used in research and HPC (high-performance computing) tools that require robust CLI interfaces.
Build tools and developer utilities: Helps build CLI wrappers or command-line GUIs for automation tools.
Game development tools: Useful for command-line utilities in asset pipelines or build systems.
DevOps utilities: CLI-based service managers or configuration tools.

CLI11 is a command line parser for C++11 and beyond that provides a rich feature set with a simple and intuitive interface.
