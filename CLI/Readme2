**C++ CLI applications are still in use**, especially in the following contexts:

---

### ‚úÖ **When C++ CLI Apps Are Still Relevant**

#### 1. **Systems Programming & Tools**

* Tools for DevOps, debugging, file processing, or low-level scripting.
* Command-line utilities for configuring embedded systems or custom hardware.

#### 2. **Scientific and High-Performance Computing (HPC)**

* Many researchers and engineers use C++ CLI tools for batch jobs, simulations, and data processing because of speed and memory control.

#### 3. **Build Systems and Toolchains**

* Many C++ projects come with CLI tools (e.g., compilers, linters, generators).
* Libraries like **CLI11** help modernize these interfaces.

#### 4. **Cross-Platform Development**

* C++ CLI apps can run with minimal dependencies across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

#### 5. **Containerized Workflows**

* CLI tools written in C++ are commonly used in Docker containers for performance-sensitive operations.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Where It's Less Common Today**

* **End-user apps**: GUI or web apps have largely replaced CLI for most consumers.
* **Scripting and automation**: Python, Bash, or PowerShell are preferred due to faster development time unless performance is critical.

---

### üîß Modern Usage Enhancements

* Use of **CMake** for clean builds.
* **CLI11** or **cxxopts** for argument parsing.
* **Catch2 / doctest** for testing.
* Integration with **CI/CD pipelines** and **DevOps tooling**.

---

### üß† Real-World Examples

* **LLVM tools** like `clang`, `lld`, etc., are all C++ CLI tools.
* **Vcpkg**, a C++ package manager by Microsoft, is a CLI tool written in C++.
* Internal developer tools in finance, aerospace, and research often rely on C++ CLI tools.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

**Yes, C++ CLI apps are still very much in use, especially in developer-facing tools, scientific computing, and performance-critical tasks.** They may not be trendy, but they‚Äôre dependable, efficient, and often essential.
