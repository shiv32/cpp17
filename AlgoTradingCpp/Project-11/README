Bollinger Band Swing Trading Logic

      Bollinger Bands:
            Upper Band: SMA + (Multiplier × Standard Deviation)
            Lower Band: SMA - (Multiplier × Standard Deviation)

      Buy Signal:
            Triggered when the close price crosses above the lower Bollinger Band.

      Sell Signal:
            Triggered when the close price crosses below the upper Bollinger Band.

      Profit Calculation:
            Buy and sell prices are used to calculate the profit for each trade.
