Algorithmic trading

    Generate a mock dataset for a stock with columns: Date, OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, and VOLUME.
    This program uses random values to simulate daily price changes and volumes, writes the data into a CSV file,
    and ensures a logical relationship between the generated values.
