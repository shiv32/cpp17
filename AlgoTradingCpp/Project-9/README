Algorithmic trading

    Hereâ€™s an implementation of a simple swing trading algorithm in C++ for predicting buy and sell signals based on 
    stock prices. 
    This example uses moving averages (a common technical indicator) to make trading decisions.

    Strategy Overview

      Indicators:
            Short-Term Moving Average (SMA): Tracks recent price trends.
            Long-Term Moving Average (LMA): Tracks broader price trends.

      Signals:
            Buy: When SMA crosses above LMA (bullish crossover).
            Sell: When SMA crosses below LMA (bearish crossover).
