/*
Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a skeleton of an algorithm 
in a base class and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.

The Template Method defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, 
allowing derived classes to override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

Usage examples: 
    The Template Method pattern is quite common in C++ frameworks. 
    Developers often use it to provide framework users with a simple means of extending standard functionality using inheritance.
