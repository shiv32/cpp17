Which Design Pattern Should You Choose?

    Project Type	                Best Pattern(s)
    Console Utility	                Singleton, Factory
    GUI (Qt-based)	                MVC, Observer
    Game Development	            Singleton, Strategy, Observer
    AI/ML Systems	                Strategy, Factory
    Enterprise Applications	        Factory, Observer, MVC
    Networking (Client-Server)	    Singleton, Observer


Final Thoughts

    Start simple and pick patterns as needed.
    Combine patterns when necessary (e.g., Factory + Singleton for database connections).
    Avoid over-engineeringâ€”patterns should solve problems, not create complexity.
