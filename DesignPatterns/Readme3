For C++ architect 👷‍♂️

in real-world C++ projects, **combining design patterns** is often more powerful than using them in isolation. 
Here's a curated list of **best pattern combinations** in C++ with common use cases, 
especially relevant to system-level programming, engines, or toolkits:

Best Combinations of Design Patterns in C++

🔧1. Factory + Strategy
Use for:** Configurable behaviors (e.g., sensor handlers, AI behavior, file format loaders)

- **Factory** creates the right **Strategy** at runtime
- Useful when behavior needs to be easily swapped or extended

cpp
auto handler = SensorHandlerFactory::create(sensorType);
handler->handle(data);  // Strategy behavior


🏭 2. Abstract Factory + Singleton
Use for:** Creating families of related objects with global access (like platforms, engines)

- **Singleton** provides one instance of **AbstractFactory**
- Used in UI toolkits, cross-platform engines, resource managers

cpp
EngineFactory::get().createRenderer();


🏗️ 3. Builder + Director + Factory
Use for:** Step-by-step construction of complex objects (e.g., game levels, JSON parsers)

- **Factory** chooses builder
- **Director** controls building process

cpp
auto builder = ObjectBuilderFactory::get("vehicle");
Director dir(builder);
dir.construct();
auto vehicle = builder->getResult();

📦 4. Composite + Visitor
Use for:** Operating on hierarchical data (e.g., scene graphs, file systems)

- **Composite** makes tree structures
- **Visitor** performs actions on them without altering node classes

cpp
SceneNode* root = buildScene();
RenderVisitor visitor;
root->accept(visitor);  // Visitor pattern applied to composite

🧩 5. Observer + Command + Mediator
Use for:** Event-driven systems (e.g., UI, sensors, networked inputs)

- **Observer** notifies subscribers
- **Command** encapsulates actions
- **Mediator** centralizes communication

cpp
eventBus.subscribe(...);
inputHandler.setCommand("jump", new JumpCommand());
mediator.notify("player_collided");


🔄 6. State + Strategy + Factory
Use for:** Stateful systems with changeable behavior (e.g., game AI, connection protocols)

- **Factory** creates strategies/states
- **Strategy** defines behavior
- **State** transitions at runtime

cpp
state = StateFactory::create("Patrol");
state->execute(agent);


⚙️ 7. Decorator + Bridge + Prototype
Use for:** Extensible systems (e.g., GUI widgets, weapons systems)

- **Decorator** adds dynamic features
- **Bridge** separates abstraction from implementation
- **Prototype** clones customizable objects

cpp
auto baseGun = new Gun();
auto silencedGun = new SilencerDecorator(baseGun);
auto cloned = silencedGun->clone();


🛠️ Tips for Combining Patterns in C++:
- Use **smart pointers** (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to manage lifetime in pattern combinations.
- **Namespace** your pattern-based components to avoid clutter (strategy::, factory::, etc.).
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**, especially with Strategy and Decorator.
