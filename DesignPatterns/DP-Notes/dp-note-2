## üß† **Design Patterns Made Easy ‚Äì What to Use and When**

| üß© **If You Want To...**                                 | ‚úÖ **Use This Pattern**         | üí¨ **Think of It Like...**                        |

| **Change parts of code easily without affecting others** | `Bridge`                       | A remote that works no matter what TV brand       |
| **Simplify a big system into one easy interface**        | `Facade`                       | A remote control for your entire home system      |
| **Save memory by reusing many small similar objects**    | `Flyweight`                    | Sharing chairs instead of making new ones         |

| **Change behavior depending on current mode/state**      | `State`                        | Phone changes mode: silent, vibrate, loud         |
| **Run commands and maybe undo them later**               | `Command`                      | A remote button you can press and undo            |
