Mini Project "Task Manager CLI"
    A simple console application that allows you to create, view, and manage tasks using a combination of design patterns.

🧱 Design Patterns Used:

    Pattern Type	Pattern	    Purpose
    Creational	    Factory	    Create different types of tasks.
    Structural	    Composite	Support nested tasks (subtasks).
    Behavioral	    Command	    Encapsulate user commands (add, remove, list).
    Behavioral	    Observer	Notify UI or logger when tasks change.
    Creational	    Singleton	Ensure a single instance of TaskManager.

📁 File/Component Structure:

    Task (base class)
    SimpleTask, CompositeTask (Composite pattern)
    TaskFactory (Factory pattern)
    TaskManager (Singleton, Observer)
    Command Interface + AddTaskCommand, ListTasksCommand, etc.
    Main.cpp (User interface loop)
