Hybrid Example: Template + Runtime Factory

 We combine template-based strategies with runtime flexibility. This approach gives you:

✅ Compile-time performance for core logic
✅ Runtime flexibility through a common base + factory
✅ Avoids excessive virtual calls inside the strategy itself


Bonus Benefits:
Strategy logic stays type-safe and inlineable.
You can reuse SensorHandlerImpl<T> for many components.
Easy to extend: just add new types and register them in the factory.
