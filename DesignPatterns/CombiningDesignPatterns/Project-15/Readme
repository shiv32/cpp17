Here's a complete C++17 console-based Sensor Monitoring System that uses multiple design patterns:

✅ Patterns Implemented:
    Observer – Notifies logger when sensor data changes
    Factory Method – Dynamically creates different sensor types
    Strategy – Different processing strategies (e.g., smoothing)
    Singleton – Centralized SensorManager
    Command – Encapsulates polling as a command
    Decorator – Adds threshold alert to sensors
