The C++ code for the mini project

Microservices Simulator

Combining the following design patterns:

Mediator (Singleton) - for inter-service communication.
Observer - for notifying subscribed services.
Chain of Responsibility - for request processing (Auth → Validation → Storage).

-----------------------------------------
Uses: 
You can run this as a console app. 
Just type requests (like auth user123) to simulate service processing and notifications.
