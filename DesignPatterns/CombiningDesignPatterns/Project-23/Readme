Data Processor Framework
A type-generic data processing system where different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings) 
are processed via plug-in algorithms at runtime. The app can log the process and notify observers.

ðŸ”§ Design Patterns Used
    Pattern	            Use
    Template Method	    IProcessor<T> provides base process flow
    Strategy	        Plug-in processing logic by type
    Factory Method	    ProcessorFactory creates processors
    Singleton	        Logger writes to console/file
    Observer	        Notify observers when processing is done
    Template	        IProcessor<T> is templated for type safety
