Sensor Monitoring Dashboard

Design Patterns Used

Observer:       Monitor sensor data changes and notify alerts/loggers.
Factory Method: Create different sensor types dynamically.
Strategy:       Different data processing or filtering algorithms per sensor.

//Future work
Singleton:      Central SensorManager to register and manage sensors.
Command:        Encapsulate sensor commands like calibrate, reset, start, stop.
Decorator:      Add features to sensors like data smoothing or thresholds.
