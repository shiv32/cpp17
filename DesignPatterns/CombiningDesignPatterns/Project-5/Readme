The C++ code for the Quiz Engine with Plugin System has been created. 

It uses the following design patterns:

Factory         – to instantiate different question types.
Strategy        – for flexible scoring systems.
Template Method – to define a consistent question execution flow.
Observer        – to update score observers after each question.
