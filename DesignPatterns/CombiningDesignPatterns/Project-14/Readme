Hereâ€™s a fun and educational way to print "Hello, World!" in C++ using a combination of design patterns. 
We'll combine several common design patterns even for such a simple task, just to illustrate how they work together.

ðŸ§  Design Patterns Used:
    Singleton           â€“ Ensure one global instance of the printer.
    Factory Method      â€“ Create a message object.
    Strategy            â€“ Choose how to format the message.
    Command             â€“ Encapsulate the print action.
    Observer            â€“ Notify when message is printed.

ðŸ§© What You Learned:
    How to apply design patterns to even a trivial task.
    How patterns can interact and layer responsibilities.
