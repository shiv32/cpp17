Project: Flexible Logger System

Goal:
    Build a flexible logging framework that:
        Uses variadic templates to accept any number/type of log arguments.

        Applies design patterns like:
            Singleton – global logging access.
            Strategy – multiple output methods (console, file).
            Decorator – timestamp, log level enhancement.
            Factory – for creating formatters or outputs.
            Observer – notify subscribers (e.g., GUI, remote logger).
            Command – queue or buffer logs.
