🛠️ Project Name: Task Scheduler Console App

✅ Overview
    A console-based task scheduler that lets users add tasks (like printing messages or executing simple math functions) 
    with simulated time delays.

🧱 Design Patterns:
    Command (for task encapsulation)
    Singleton (for scheduler instance)
    Factory Method (for creating tasks)
    Observer (to notify on task status change)

🔗 std::bind to bind task functions with arguments and delay


Note:
    Prefer lambdas over std::bind in modern C++ (C++11 and later)
    unless you're doing something that lambdas can't express easily.
