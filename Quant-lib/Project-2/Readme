    This C++ project uses QuantLib to price a fixed-rate bond and demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern.

    FixedRateBondWrapper: Wraps a QuantLib bond.
    DiscountingStrategy: Calculates bond price using a yield curve.
    BondPricer: Applies any pricing strategy to a bond.

ðŸ”§ Why?
    To allow flexible pricing methods (e.g., discounting, yield-to-maturity) without changing core logic.

ðŸ’¡ Real Use:
    Used in finance apps to model and price bonds using pluggable strategies.
