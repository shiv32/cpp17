**Key difference in a nutshell:**

* **Data Structures** are **containers**—they define *how* data is stored and organized.
* **Algorithms** are **recipes**—they define *how* data is processed or manipulated to solve a problem.

### 1. Definition

| Aspect      | Data Structures                                     | Algorithms                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Organize and store data efficiently.                | Provide a step-by-step procedure to perform a task or solve a problem. |
| **Focus**   | *What* form the data takes (layout, relationships). | *How* to operate on that data (logic, sequence of steps).              |

### 2. Examples

* **Data Structures:**

  * Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  * Trees (Binary, AVL), Graphs
  * Hash Tables, Heaps

* **Algorithms:**

  * Searching (Binary Search, DFS, BFS)
  * Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort)
  * Shortest Path (Dijkstra, A\*)
  * Dynamic Programming techniques

---

### 3. Relationship

* They complement each other.

  * Choosing the right **data structure** can make an **algorithm** faster or simpler.
  * Example:

    * **Stack (data structure)** + **DFS (algorithm)** → Graph traversal.
    * **Priority Queue (data structure)** + **Dijkstra’s algorithm** → Shortest path.

### 4. Analogy

Think of building a house:

* **Data Structure = Storage** (rooms, cupboards, layout).
* **Algorithm = Method** (the order and technique you follow to build, paint, or furnish).

---

### 5. Practical Takeaway

When solving problems:

1. **Model the data** with a suitable data structure.
2. **Design an algorithm** that operates on it efficiently in terms of **time** and **space complexity**.

In short, **data structures are about *representation*, algorithms are about *computation*.**
