Brute force solution

In C++ (or any language), a brute-force solution simply means:

    Solve the problem by trying all possible solutions directly, without clever optimizations.

C++ is just the tool — brute force is a problem-solving approach, not a language feature.

Brute force = “try everything, no shortcuts.”
Simple, correct, but often slow.

-----------------------------------------------
eg. Problem
    Given an array, check if there exists a pair whose sum = target.

    Array: {2, 7, 11, 15}
    Target: 9
-----------------------------------------------

“Brute force checks all combinations; 
optimized solutions reduce work using data structures or math.”

Real interview rule 
    1️⃣ Explain brute force first
    2️⃣ State its complexity
    3️⃣ Improve it using:
        STL containers
        sorting
        hashing
        DP / greedy
