âš¡ Project: HFT Signal Engine Simulator

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Build a low-latency simulation engine that:
            Receives real-time market data
            Computes simple signals (like momentum or mean-reversion)
            Sends orders based on strategy
            Measures simulated latency (in nanoseconds)

        Design Pattern	            Used For
        Factory	                    To create strategies and commands
        Command	                    Encapsulate order send logic
        Strategy	                Define trading logic
        Observer	                Market feed â†’ trader
        Data Model	                Order struct
        Separation of Concerns	    Modular classes for strategy, trader, command, feed, etc.
