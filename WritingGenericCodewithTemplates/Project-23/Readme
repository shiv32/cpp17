/*
Friend Function Templates of Class Templates
    Function templates are useful when you want to overload operators in a class template.
    The only problem with this implementation is that it accesses private member mCells of the Grid class.

    You can make a function template a friend of a class template.
    friend function in C++ can access private and protected members of a class.

    g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o test && ./test && rm test
