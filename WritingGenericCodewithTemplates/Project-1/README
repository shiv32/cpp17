Writing Generic Code with Templates
        C++ provides language support not only for object-oriented programming, but also for generic programming. 
        The goal of generic programming is to write reusable code.
        The fundamental tools for generic programming in C++ are templates. 
        Although not strictly an object-oriented feature, templates can be combined with object-oriented programming 
        for powerful results. 
        As a professional C++ programmer, you need to know about them.
