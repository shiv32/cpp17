About SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

SFML is a modern, easy-to-use C++ multimedia library designed for developing 2D games and graphical applications. 

It provides a simple API to handle:
    Window creation and management
    Graphics rendering (shapes, sprites, text)
    Input handling (keyboard, mouse, joystick)
    Audio playback (sounds, music)
    Networking

SFML abstracts low-level details, allowing developers to focus on game logic and design. 
Itâ€™s cross-platform, lightweight, and ideal for beginners and professionals alike.
