Install Doxygen on Ubuntu

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doxygen

Install GraphViz

doxygen requires GraphViz to generate call graphs and class diagrams via the dot utility. So install GraphViz, and the dot utility, like this:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install graphviz

# Ensure it is now installed
dot -V  # shows the version
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

Once installed, all you need is a project with Doxygen-compatible comments and a Doxyfile, a configuration file that controls the behavior of Doxygen.

If there is no Doxyfile yet, you can simply let Doxygen generate a standard template. To do so, navigate to the root of your project and run:

doxygen -g

The -g stands for generate. You should now notice a newly created file called Doxyfile.

set the attribute in Doxyfile file like 

INPUT = ../
FILE_PATTERNS = *.hpp \
                *.cpp 

You can invoke Doxygen by simply running:

doxygen

You should now notice two newly created folders:

    html/
    latex/
