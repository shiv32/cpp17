Usually — **most home routers do *not* use Nginx.**
Let’s see why and what they actually use instead 👇

## 🧩 1. Why routers usually don’t use Nginx

Nginx is a **powerful general-purpose web server**, but:

* It’s **too heavy** for tiny router hardware (limited RAM + CPU).
* Routers need only a few simple endpoints — not full web hosting.
* Nginx depends on libraries and configs not ideal for embedded systems.

So router firmware uses **very small, embedded web servers** designed for low-memory environments.

## 🧱 2. What routers actually use instead

| Router type                                | Common embedded web servers              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| OpenWRT / DD-WRT                           | **uHTTPd** or **lighttpd**               |
| TP-Link, D-Link, Netgear (custom firmware) | Custom C-based servers or **mini_httpd** |
| AsusWRT                                    | **httpd** (BusyBox-based)                |
| Mikrotik                                   | Their own proprietary `webfig` backend   |
| Industrial routers                         | Often use **lighttpd** or **mongoose**   |

All of these are **tiny HTTP servers** — typically a few hundred KB in size.

## 🧠 3. What they do (just like Nginx, but smaller)

They still handle:

* HTTP request parsing
* Static file serving (HTML, JS, CSS for admin page)
* CGI or REST API endpoints (for commands like `/set_wifi.cgi`)
* Authentication (login/password)

Example on OpenWRT:

```
/usr/sbin/uhttpd
  ├── serves /www/index.html
  ├── handles /cgi-bin/luci
```

The **Luci** web interface uses Lua scripts as CGI handlers.

## ⚙️ 4. Could a router use Nginx?

Technically, yes — advanced routers or **x86-based systems (OpenWRT on PC)** can install Nginx:

```bash
opkg install nginx
```

Then it can serve a custom dashboard, API, or reverse proxy.

But most commercial routers (TP-Link, Netgear, etc.) use **lightweight servers** to save flash and RAM.

### ✅ In short

| Feature          | Nginx                   | Router Built-In (uhttpd, mini_httpd) |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Size             | ~1–2 MB                 | < 300 KB                             |
| Features         | Full web/proxy, caching | Simple config UI only                |
| Used in routers  | ❌ Rare                  | ✅ Common                             |
| Performance goal | High concurrency        | Low footprint                        |
