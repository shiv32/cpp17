Plugin Architecture(C++):

    The app loads a default plugin plus any plugins specified at runtime as shared libraries. 

    Plugins implement a common interface and export factory functions. 

    New plugins can be added simply by compiling them as shared libraries and passing their names to the app,
    no app code changes needed.

Summary:

    Plugin Architecture : talking about the design/structure.
    Plugin System       : talking about the implementation/mechanism.
