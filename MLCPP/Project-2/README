Linear Regression Overview
        Linear regression predicts the value of a dependent variable (y) based on an independent variable (x). 
        The relationship is modeled as:

                y=mâ‹…x+b

                Where:
                m: Slope (weight)
                b: Intercept (bias)

The algorithm minimizes the error between predictions and actual data using the mean squared error (MSE).
