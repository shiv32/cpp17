 Machine learning example in C++: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. 
 This algorithm predicts the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors in a feature space.

 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier Example

        1. How KNN Works
                Training: KNN doesn't involve "training" in the traditional sense. 
                          It stores the data points in memory.

                Prediction: To classify a new data point:

                        Compute the distance to all training points.
                        Find the k closest points.
                        Take a majority vote of their classes.
