/*

A basic example of a machine learning algorithm implemented in C++: Linear Regression. 
This simple algorithm finds the best-fit line for a set of points, minimizing the mean squared error.

Explanation:

Input Data:
        The x vector contains independent variables.
        The y vector contains dependent variables (output).

Mean Calculation:
        A helper function computes the mean of a vector.

Slope (m) and Intercept (b):
        Using the least-squares method, the algorithm calculates the best-fit line's slope and intercept.

Prediction:
        The model predicts y values for new x inputs using the formula:
                y=mx+b
