Complete CRTP Engine Example
    We’ll simulate:
            Engine calls onTick()
            Strategy defines its own behavior
            No virtual functions
            Compile-time polymorphism

Why This Is Powerful in Trading
    In low-latency systems:
        No virtual
        No vtable
        Fully inlined
        Zero runtime polymorphism cost

    This pattern is common in:
        Matching engines
        Strategy engines
        Risk engines
        Logging frameworks
-------------------------------------------------------
Engine* e = new PrintStrategy(); // ❌  runtime polymorphism
CRTP = compile-time polymorphism.
