Rule of Zero

    "Classes that manage resources should not need to implement special member functions at all."

You delegate resource management to RAII classes like std::string, std::vector, std::unique_ptr, etc., 
and let the compiler generate:

    Constructor
    Destructor
    Copy/move constructor
    Copy/move assignment

Thus, you write zero of the "big five".


Follows Rule of Zero: no user-defined special member functions.
Safer, cleaner, more maintainable â€” leverages RAII and STL types.
Use this approach unless:
    You're managing raw resources (e.g. raw pointers, file handles).
    You need custom copy/move behavior.
