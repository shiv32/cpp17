 Rule of Five

    Interview Points to Explain
        Follows Rule of Five: implements destructor, copy/move constructors, and copy/move assignment operators.
        Prevents resource leaks by managing dynamic memory.
        Uses noexcept in move operations (good practice in C++11 and beyond).
        delete[] is called only on owned memory to avoid double delete.

        Uses std::unique_ptr<std::string> to manage dynamic memory safely.
        Still follows Rule of Five, but
            Move constructor and assignment are marked as = default because unique_ptr handles them correctly.
            Copy operations are manually implemented for deep copies.
        Clean, exception-safe, and no manual memory management.
