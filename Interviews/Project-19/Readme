Heap basic

----------------------------------
Here's the precedence order for these operators from highest to lowest:

. (member access operator) - Highest precedence
-> (member access through pointer) - Same precedence as .
* (dereference operator) - Lower precedence


Associativity
. and -> operators:         Left to right associativity
* (dereference) operator:   Right to left associativity

Note:   Associativity determines the order of evaluation when operators of 
        the same precedence appear in an expression.
