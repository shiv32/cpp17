In C++ delete Vs malloc

The difference is that the Foo object pointed to by myFoo isn’t a proper object because 
it was never constructed. 
The malloc() function only sets aside a piece of memory of a certain size. 
It doesn’t know about or care about objects. 
With free(), the object’s destructor is not called. 

The call to new allocates the appropriate size of memory and also calls an appropriate 
constructor to construct the object.
With delete, the destructor is called and the object is properly cleaned up.

WARNING 
        You should never use malloc() and free() in C++. 
        Use only new and delete.
