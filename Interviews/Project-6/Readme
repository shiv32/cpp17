Demonstrates all 7 classic structural design patterns

Adapter     – Wraps old interface to match a new one.
Bridge      – Separates abstraction (Shape) from implementation (DrawingAPI).
Composite   – Tree structure where leaf and container are treated uniformly.
Decorator   – Adds behavior dynamically to an object.
Facade      – Simplified interface to a complex system.
Flyweight   – Shares objects to reduce memory.
Proxy       – Controls access to another object.
