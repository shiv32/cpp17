Illustrates the 5 SOLID principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP)

    SRP – InvoiceData handles data; InvoicePrinter handles printing.
    OCP – New shapes can be added without modifying totalArea.
    LSP – Sparrow can replace Bird.
    ISP – Separate small interfaces (printer vs scanner).
    DIP – Notification depends on IMessageSender, not a concrete sender.
