## 🧠 Why Still Code in **Standard C++** (Without External Libraries)?

Even with many powerful C++ libraries available (like Boost, Qt, POCO, etc.), coding in **standard C++ (ISO C++)** has **important benefits** — especially in real-world development:

---

### ✅ 1. **Portability**

* Standard C++ runs anywhere a compliant compiler is available (GCC, Clang, MSVC).
* No extra build steps, dependencies, or runtime requirements.

📌 *Example:* Embedded systems, IoT devices, or restricted environments often **only allow standard C++**.

---

### ✅ 2. **Stability & Longevity**

* ISO C++ features are standardized, consistent, and evolve with care.
* Unlike third-party libraries that may break compatibility or get deprecated.

📌 *Example:* `std::filesystem` replaced many Boost filesystem use cases in C++17.

---

### ✅ 3. **Zero Dependencies**

* Fewer headaches with builds, CI/CD, cross-platform support, and licensing.
* Easier onboarding for teams — no external setup.

📌 *Ideal for:* Simple tools, student projects, interviews, and teaching.

---

### ✅ 4. **Performance & Control**

* Standard C++ gives **fine-grained control** over memory, types, and behavior.
* STL containers and algorithms are highly optimized and often outperform hand-written code.

---

### ✅ 5. **Learn Core Language Concepts**

* You master:

  * Memory management
  * Templates & generics
  * RAII
  * Lambdas & functional style
  * Standard algorithms
  * Multithreading (via `std::thread`, `std::async`, etc.)

📌 *Boost and Qt are great — but they often abstract or hide these core principles.*

---

### ✅ 6. **C++ Keeps Evolving**

Modern C++ versions (C++17, C++20, C++23) have added:

* `std::optional`, `std::variant`
* Ranges, coroutines
* Concepts and constraints
* `std::filesystem`, `std::chrono`, `std::format`, etc.

➡️ **Many tasks that once needed libraries can now be done with just standard C++.**

## 🚀 When to Use External Libraries

Use external libraries when:

* You need high-level features (e.g., GUI, networking, serialization).
* Productivity matters more than full control.
* You're building something large or cross-platform.

📚 Good Practice: **Start with standard C++**, then **bring in libraries only when needed**.
