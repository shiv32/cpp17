C++17 mini project using POCO libraries with design patterns.

We'll do a simple HTTP REST Client example using:
    Singleton Pattern (for HTTP client manager)
    Factory Pattern (to create HTTP requests)
    Observer Pattern (to notify on response)
    Command Pattern (to execute requests)

How this works:
    Singleton: HttpClientManager manages HTTP sessions.
    Factory: HttpRequestFactory creates HTTP requests by method and URI.
    Command: HttpGetCommand encapsulates the GET request execution.
    Observer: ConsoleResponseObserver is notified once a response is received and prints it.
