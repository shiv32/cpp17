Sean Baxter is a well-known C++ developer and language innovator, especially famous in modern C++ circles.

Sean Baxter works almost entirely in the headless / non-GUI domain.
His work is compiler + language tooling, not GUI apps.

What domain Sean Baxter actually works in

    Primary domain
        Compilers
        Language tooling
        Static analysis
        Code generation
        Metaprogramming
        Build-time systems

    This is pure headless C++:
        No windows
        No buttons
        No UI frameworks
        Mostly CLI tools and compiler pipelines

Think:
    source code → compiler → AST → codegen → binary
That’s his world

What he does NOT focus on
    Game GUIs
    Qt / SFML / Unreal UI
    Desktop apps
    Web frontends

Not because they’re bad — just not his problem space.
