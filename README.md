2. Design Patterns

    1. Behavioral (how objects send messages to each other) ->  Chain of responsibility, Observer, Iterator, State
    
    2. Structural (defining relationships between objects) -> Adaptor, Proxy, Decorator
    
    3. Creational (flexible ways to create objects) ->  Singleton, Factory, Abstract factory
