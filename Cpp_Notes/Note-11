  [https://github.com/sharkdp/bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

---

## ✅ Game / Simulation (Console Only)

* **libtcod** – Roguelike console engine
  [https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod)

* **Angband** – Classic ASCII roguelike
  [https://github.com/angband/angband](https://github.com/angband/angband)

---

## ⭐ Highly Recommended for YOU (based on your history)

Since you focus on **console-only, design-pattern-heavy C++**, you should **build and publish** projects like:

* File Search Tool (`grep`-like)
* SQLite-style mini DB in C++
* Plugin-based CLI tool
* Sensor monitoring system
* Log analyzer
* Git-like version control system

These look **excellent on GitHub** and in interviews.

### 🔥 Truth

> **Most professional C++ developers work on non-GUI code.**
> Console apps + libraries = real C++ mastery.
