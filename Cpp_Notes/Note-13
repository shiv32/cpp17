Where modern C++ IS enough (no external libs)
You do NOT need external libs for:

    ✅ Data structures
    ✅ Algorithms
    ✅ Multithreading (std::thread, mutex)
    ✅ File I/O
    ✅ Memory management
    ✅ RAII
    ✅ Generic programming
    ✅ Performance-critical core logic
    ✅ System-level engines
    ✅ Embedded logic

This is why in HFT, OS, DB engines, compilers, the core is pure C++, and libs are used only at the edges.

Mental model (important)
    C++ standard    = language + core tools
    Libraries       = domain power

Modern C++ is strong at “how” things work, not “what” domain you work in.
For anything beyond CPU + memory + files → external libs are normal and expected.

Where standard/modern C++ is NOT enough (needs external libs) 

    Database access                     → no SQL / DB API in standard C++
    Networking (TCP/HTTP/WebSocket)     → no sockets / HTTP in STL
    JSON / XML / YAML parsing           → no data format parsers
    GUI / Desktop UI                    → no windows, buttons, events
    Image / Video / Audio               → no multimedia support
    Logging systems                     → cout is not a logger
    Serialization (object ↔ bytes)      → no built-in serializer
    Unit testing                        → no test framework
    Compression                         → no zip / lz support
    Cryptography / SSL                  → intentionally excluded
    REST / Microservices                → no HTTP server/client
    Game engines / Physics / Rendering  → no graphics or physics
    Cloud / AWS / GCP SDKs              → no cloud APIs
    Machine learning / AI               → no ML framework
    Package management                  → no standard package manager

Rule of thumb:
👉 If it talks to network, UI, DB, cloud, media, or security → external lib needed.
