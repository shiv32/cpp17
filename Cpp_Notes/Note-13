Where standard/modern C++ is NOT enough (needs external libs) 

    Database access                     → no SQL / DB API in standard C++
    Networking (TCP/HTTP/WebSocket)     → no sockets / HTTP in STL
    JSON / XML / YAML parsing           → no data format parsers
    GUI / Desktop UI                    → no windows, buttons, events
    Image / Video / Audio               → no multimedia support
    Logging systems                     → cout is not a logger
    Serialization (object ↔ bytes)      → no built-in serializer
    Unit testing                        → no test framework
    Compression                         → no zip / lz support
    Cryptography / SSL                  → intentionally excluded
    REST / Microservices                → no HTTP server/client
    Game engines / Physics / Rendering  → no graphics or physics
    Cloud / AWS / GCP SDKs              → no cloud APIs
    Machine learning / AI               → no ML framework
    Package management                  → no standard package manager

Rule of thumb:
👉 If it talks to network, UI, DB, cloud, media, or security → external lib needed.
