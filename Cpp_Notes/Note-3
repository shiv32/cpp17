Declarations and definitions ->

C++ separates:
    Declarations (what exists — in header files .h or .hpp)
    Definitions (how it works — in source files .cpp)

| Language | Declarations Separate? | Typical File Split | Linking Model  |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| **C++**  | Yes                    | `.h` + `.cpp`      | Compile → Link |
| **Java** | No                     | `.java` only       | Managed by JVM |
| **C#**   | No                     | `.cs` only         | Managed by CLR |


C++ uses a compile-link model — each .cpp is compiled independently, and the linker connects them later.

CLR -> Common Language Runtime.
JVM -> Java Virtual Machine
