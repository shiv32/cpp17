Here are **good C++ projects on GitHub that are 100% non-GUI (CLI / system / library focused)**. 
These are *real-world style*, not toy apps — perfect if you want to master **pure C++** 👇
---
## 🔹 Beginner–Intermediate (Console / Core C++)

Good for understanding **clean design, STL, file handling, OOP**

1. **CLI Todo App**

   * `CLI11` (library)
   * Repo: `CLIUtils/CLI11`
   * Shows argument parsing, clean C++ API design

2. **C++ JSON Library**

   * Repo: `nlohmann/json`
   * Header-only, modern C++, no GUI
   * Excellent example of templates & operator overloading

3. **spdlog**

   * Repo: `gabime/spdlog`
   * Fast logging library used in production
   * Pure C++, no GUI

---

## 🔹 Intermediate (System / Performance / Tools)

4. **ripgrep (C++ parts & inspiration)**

   * Repo: `BurntSushi/ripgrep`
   * Though Rust-based, C++ devs often re-implement parts as practice

5. **C++ HTTP Server (CLI)**

   * Repo: `yhirose/cpp-httplib`
   * Header-only HTTP library
   * Great networking + threading example

6. **SQLite**

   * Repo: `sqlite/sqlite`
   * One of the **most famous C projects**, but heavily used in C++
   * Console-based database engine

---

## 🔹 Advanced / Hardcore C++ (No GUI, Industry Level)

7. **LLVM**

   * Repo: `llvm/llvm-project`
   * Compiler infrastructure
   * Massive C++ codebase

8. **Redis (C core, C++ inspired tools exist)**

   * Repo: `redis/redis`
   * Learn networking, memory, performance concepts

9. **Catch2**

   * Repo: `catchorg/Catch2`
   * Unit testing framework in modern C++

---

## 🔹 Game / Simulation (Console Only)

10. **Rogue-like Console Games**

* Repo: `libtcod/libtcod`
* Console-based game logic
* No GUI windows required

11. **Dwarf Fortress (logic inspiration)**

* ASCII-based simulation style (conceptual learning)

---

## 🔹 Build Systems / Tooling (Very Important)

12. **CMake**

* Repo: `Kitware/CMake`
* Learn professional project structure

13. **Ninja**

* Repo: `ninja-build/ninja`
* Fast build system written in C++

---

## 🔹 If You Want to Build Your OWN GitHub Project (Recommended)

Since you already focus on **console C++ projects**, here are **excellent project ideas** you should put on GitHub:

* ✔️ File Search Tool (like `find`)
* ✔️ Log Analyzer
* ✔️ Text-based Database (SQLite-style)
* ✔️ Network Packet Analyzer (pcap)
* ✔️ Git-like Version Control Tool
* ✔️ Task Scheduler (cron-like)
* ✔️ Shell / Command Interpreter
* ✔️ System Monitor (CPU, RAM via `/proc`)

## 🔥 Truth (Important for Your Career)

> **Top C++ developers mostly work on non-GUI code**
> OS, databases, compilers, engines, servers, finance systems — all console or library based.
