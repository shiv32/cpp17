/*
        Overloading Arithmetic Operators
            Declarations of +, -, *, and /, where you have to replace <op> with +, -, *, and /, 
            resulting in four functions. 

            SpreadsheetCell operator<op>(const SpreadsheetCell& lhs, const SpreadsheetCell& rhs);
           
            You can also overload %, but it doesnâ€™t make sense for the double values stored in SpreadsheetCells.
          
            For operator/, the only tricky aspect is remembering to check for division by zero.
            This implementation throws an exception if division by zero is detected.

                eg.
                    SpreadsheetCell operator/(const SpreadsheetCell& lhs, const SpreadsheetCell& rhs)
                        {
                            if (rhs.getValue() == 0) {
                            throw invalid_argument("Divide by zero.");
                        }
                            return SpreadsheetCell(lhs.getValue() / rhs.getValue());
                        }
