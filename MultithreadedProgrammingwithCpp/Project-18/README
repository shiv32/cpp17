/*

Exception Handling
    A big advantage of using futures is that they can transport exceptions between threads. 
    Calling get() on a future either returns the calculated result, or rethrows any exception that has been
    stored in the promise linked to the future. 
    
    When you use packaged_task or async(), any exception thrown from the launched function is automatically 
    stored in the promise. 
    If you use std::promise as your promise, you can call set_exception() to store an exception in it.
