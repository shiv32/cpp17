std::packaged_task
    An std::packaged_task makes it easier to work with promises than explicitly using std::promise.
    
    Code demonstrates this. 
    It creates a packaged_task to execute CalculateSum(). 
    The future is retrieved from the packaged_task by calling get_future(). 
    A thread is launched, and the packaged_task is moved into it. 
    A packaged_task cannot be copied! 
    After the thread is launched, get() is called on the retrieved future to get the result. 
    This blocks until the result is available.

    Note that CalculateSum() does not need to store anything explicitly in any kind of promise.
    A packaged_task automatically creates a promise, automatically stores the result of the called
    function, CalculateSum() in this case, in the promise, and automatically stores any exceptions
    thrown from the function in the promise.
