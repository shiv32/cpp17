/*
Cancelling Threads
        The C++ standard does not include any mechanism for cancelling a running thread from another
        thread. 
        The best way to achieve this is to provide some communication mechanism that the two threads 
        agree upon. 
        The simplest mechanism is to have a shared variable, which the target thread
        checks periodically to determine if it should terminate. 
        Other threads can set this shared variable to indirectly instruct the thread to shut down. 
        You have to be careful here, because this shared variable is being accessed by multiple threads, 
        of which at least one is writing to the shared variable. 
        Itâ€™s recommended to use atomic variables or condition variables.
