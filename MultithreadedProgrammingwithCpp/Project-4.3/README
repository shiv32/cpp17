Retrieving Results from Threads
        Launching a new thread is pretty easy. 
        In most cases you are probably interested in results produced by the thread. 
        
        For example, if your thread performs some mathematical calculations, you really would like to get 
        the results out of the thread once the thread is finished. 
        
        One way is to pass a pointer or reference to a result variable to the thread in which the thread 
        stores the results. 
        Another method is to store the results inside class member variables of a function object, which 
        you can retrieve later once the thread has finished executing.

        This only works if you use std::ref() to pass your function object by reference to the thread
        constructor.
        
        There is another easier method to obtain a result from threads: futures. 
        Futures also make it easier to handle errors that occur inside your threads.
