Blockchain
    A blockchain is a distributed, secure, and immutable digital ledger that records transactions in linked blocks. 
    Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, making it tamper-proof.

Key Features:
    Decentralized:  No central authority; many participants keep copies.
    Immutable:      Once data is recorded, it cannot be changed.
    Secure:         Uses cryptography to secure data and verify transactions.
    Transparent:    Transactions are visible to all participants.

Common Applications:
    Cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin):     Digital money without banks.
    Supply Chain:                       Track goods and verify authenticity.
    Voting Systems:                     Secure, transparent election voting.
    Digital Identity:                   Verified personal data without central control.
    Healthcare:                         Secure patient records sharing.
    Smart Contracts:                    Automated agreements that execute when conditions are met.
