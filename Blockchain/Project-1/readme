/*

Here's a basic C++17 blockchain implementation in a single-file console application, 
perfect for learning how blockchains work. 

This example includes:

    Basic Block structure
    Blockchain container
    SHA-256 hashing
    Proof-of-work mining
    Console interaction

üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated

    Concept	        C++ Feature Used
    Hashing	        SHA-256 via OpenSSL
    Time	        std::time_t, ctime()
    Blockchain	    std::vector<Block>
    Mining	        Proof-of-work (nonce)
    Modern C++	    Constructors, stringstream, move semantics

‚úÖ Next Steps
You can expand this project by adding:

    Transactions and wallets
    Digital signatures (ECDSA)
    Networking (POCO / Boost ASIO)
    JSON storage (nlohmann/json)
    Persistent storage (SQLite)

üêß Linux Dependencies

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install g++ cmake libssl-dev -y

 Check Installed Versions

    g++ --version       # Should show g++ 7+ or clang++
    cmake --version     # Should be 3.10+
    openssl version     # Should show OpenSSL 1.1 or 3.x
