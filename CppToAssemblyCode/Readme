C++ to Assembly Code understanding (How compiler work) -->

1.  Put break point at main.
2.  Run debugger.
3.  Open disassembly view by right click on program space.
4.  Now split the window by click on top right corner.
5.  Keep right side C++ code and left side disassembly view.
6.  See registers also in left side given by debugger.
7.  Click on disassembly view space and start step into(F11) in debbuger.
8.  You will see C++ and assembly code both are heighlighted at the same
    time as you step into(F11).
9.  By this way you can see how compiler working behind the scene(C++).
