Comparing vectors
    The Standard Library provides the usual six overloaded comparison operators for vectors: 
    ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=. 
    
    Two vectors are equal if they have the same number of elements and all the corresponding elements 
    in the two vectors are equal to each other. 
    
    Two vectors are compared lexicographically, that is, one vector is “less than” another if all 
    elements 0 through i–1 in the first vector are equal to elements 0 through i-1 in the second vector, 
    but element i in the first is less than element i in the second, where i must be in the 
    range 0...n and n must be less than the size() of the smallest of the two vectors.

    NOTE:   Comparing two vectors with operator== or operator!= requires the individual elements to be comparable 
            with operator==. 
            Comparing two vectors with operator<, operator>, operator<=, or operator>= requires the individual elements 
            to be comparable with operator<. 
            If you intend to store objects of a custom class in a vector, make sure to write those operators.

    Example of a simple program that compares vectors of ints:

            vector<int> vectorOne(10);
            vector<int> vectorTwo(10);

            if (vectorOne == vectorTwo) {
                cout << "equal!" << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "not equal!" << endl;
            }

            vectorOne[3] = 50;
            
            if (vectorOne < vectorTwo) {
                cout << "vectorOne is less than vectorTwo" << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "vectorOne is not less than vectorTwo" << endl;
            }

            Output: 
                equal!
                vectorOne is not less than vectorTwo
