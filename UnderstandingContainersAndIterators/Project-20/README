Special list Operations

    Splicing
        The linked-list characteristics of a list allow it to splice, or insert, an entire list at any position 
        in another list in constant time. 
  
  There are also two other forms of splice(): 
    one that inserts a single element from another list,
    one that inserts a range from another list. 

    WARNING Splicing is destructive to the list passed as an argument: it removes the spliced elements from one list 
            in order to insert them into the other.
