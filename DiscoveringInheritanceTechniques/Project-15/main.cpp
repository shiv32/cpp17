 * @brief  The Individual Derived Classes
                Writing the StringSpreadsheetCell and DoubleSpreadsheetCell classes is just a matter of
                implementing the functionality that is defined in the parent. 

                If a derived class does not implement all pure virtual methods from the base class, then 
                the derived class is abstract as well, and clients will not be able to instantiate objects of
                the derived class.
