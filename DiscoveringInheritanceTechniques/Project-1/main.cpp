 * @brief BUILDING CLASSES WITH INHERITANCE
 *          Extending Classes
 *              When you write a class definition in C++, you can tell the compiler that your class is 
 *              inheriting from, deriving from, or extending an existing class. 

                By doing so, your class automatically contains the data members and methods of the original class,
                which is called the parent class or base class or superclass. 

                Extending an existing class gives your class (which is now called a derived class or a sub-
                class) the ability to describe only the ways in which it is different from the parent class.

                To show the syntax for inheritance, two classes are used, called Base and Derived.
