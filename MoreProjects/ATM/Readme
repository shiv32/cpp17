Professionals don’t “design everything”; 
they follow a **simple repeatable thinking loop**.

Here is a **very simple, generic, human-friendly way** to design *any* C++ console app **before coding**, including ATM, games, tools, simulators, etc.

No theory overload. Just **5 steps**.

---

# A Simple 5-Step Design Method (Use This Every Time)

## STEP 1️⃣ — Write the User Story (Plain English)

Don’t think “classes”. Think **conversation**.

Example (ATM):

```
User inserts card
User enters PIN
User chooses Withdraw
ATM gives cash
ATM shows balance
```

👉 If you can’t explain it in 5–6 lines, stop.

---

## STEP 2️⃣ — Draw the FLOW (Boxes + Arrows in Your Head)

Ask only this:

> “What happens next?”

```
Start
 ↓
Insert Card
 ↓
Enter PIN
 ↓
Choose Option
 ↓
Do Work
 ↓
Exit
```

That’s it.
No patterns. No UML. Just **flow**.

---

## STEP 3️⃣ — Split INPUT / LOGIC / OUTPUT (MOST IMPORTANT)

Every console program is only this:

```
[ INPUT ] → [ LOGIC ] → [ OUTPUT ]
```

ATM example:

* **Input**: card number, pin, choice, amount
* **Logic**: validate pin, update balance
* **Output**: messages, balance, errors

👉 Rule:

> If `cin/cout` enters logic → design is wrong.

---

## STEP 4️⃣ — Name Things (Not Classes Yet)

Just write **nouns and verbs**.

### Nouns (data)

```
Card
Account
Balance
Transaction
```

### Verbs (actions)

```
validatePin
withdraw
deposit
showBalance
```

Now your brain is relaxed.
You’re **naming**, not designing.

---

## STEP 5️⃣ — Convert Names into Simple C++ Files

Now and only now, think C++.

Example mapping:

```
Account      → struct Account
Transaction  → class Transaction
ATM flow     → class ATM
Input/Output → ConsoleUI
```

No inheritance yet.
No patterns yet.
Just **functions + structs**.

---

# This Is the Only Loop You Need

Professionals repeat this loop **many times**, not once:

```
Think small
↓
Code small
↓
Improve design
↓
Repeat
```

# How C++ Pros Actually Work (Truth)

They **do NOT**:
❌ design full UML
❌ predict everything
❌ apply all patterns at start

They **DO**:
✅ start ugly
✅ refactor often
✅ rename things
✅ split files slowly

---

# Minimal ATM Design Using This Method

### 1. User Story

```
Insert card → Enter pin → Choose option → Done
```

### 2. Flow

```
Idle → Authenticated → Transaction → Exit
```

### 3. Split

* Input: menu
* Logic: balance
* Output: print

### 4. Names

```
ATM
Account
Transaction
```

### 5. First C++ Skeleton (mental)

```cpp
int main() {
    ATM atm;
    atm.run();
}
```

That’s enough to start coding.

# Golden Rule (Remember This Forever)

> **Design is not thinking more —
> design is thinking less, but clearly.**
