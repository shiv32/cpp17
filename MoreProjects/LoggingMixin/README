/*

A mixin class in C++ is a class designed to provide additional functionality to other classes through inheritance, 
but it is not intended to be instantiated on its own. 
Mixins are typically template-based and promote code reuse by composing behaviors instead of relying solely on 
deep class hierarchies.

 Example: Logging Mixin
