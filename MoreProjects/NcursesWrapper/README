ncurses is not a C++ library â€” it is written in C, 
but it can be used in C++ projects easily since C++ is compatible with C.

A simple example of wrapping basic ncurses functionality into a clean C++ class 
to make it easier to use in a modern C++17 project.

Benefits of Wrapping
    Keeps your code clean and RAII-compliant
    Avoids forgetting endwin()
    Easier to expand (add menus, input boxes, windows, etc.)
