/*

For testing debugger behaviour in client and server app at the same time.
Debugger working fine and navigating in client and server as per response from each other.

I set the Break Point in Server 

in main ->  Server server(8080);
in "Server.cpp" ->   std::cout << "[Client]: " << buffer << std::endl;


I set the Break Point in Client 

in main ->   Client client("127.0.0.1", 8080);
in Client.cpp -> std::cout << "[Server]: " << buffer << std::endl;
