Build a tiny C++ microservice example using POCO C++ Libraries (popular for HTTP/REST).

This service will expose a REST API:
GET /hello → responds with "Hello from C++ microservice!"

---------------------------------------------
Compile and run:
g++ main.cpp -o microservice -lPocoNet -lPocoUtil -lPocoFoundation
./microservice


Run:
curl http://localhost:9090/hello

Output:
{"message": "Hello from C++ microservice!"}

-----------------------------------------

You now have a working C++ REST microservice.
From here, you can expand:
    Add more endpoints (/status, /users).
    Communicate with other services (via REST/gRPC).
    Package into Docker → deploy with Kubernetes.
