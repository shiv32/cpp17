Project: Student Exam Ranking System
(C++17 + File I/O + std::multiset)

Real-World Use Case
    A coaching center wants to:
        Store student name + score
        Automatically maintain sorted ranking
        Handle duplicate scores
        Persist data to file
        Load data on program restart

Why multiset?
    Keeps data automatically sorted
    Allows duplicate marks
    Better than vector + sort for continuous insertion
