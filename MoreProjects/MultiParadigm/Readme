"Multi-Paradigm Programming with Modern C++" means that C++ (especially from C++11 onward, often called Modern C++) 
supports and encourages using multiple programming paradigms (styles or approaches) in a single language and even 
within the same project.

Single short C++17/20 program that mixes multiple paradigms 
so you can see multi-paradigm programming in action.

What this program shows:
    Procedural:         add function.
    OOP:                Shape + Circle.
    Generic:            multiply template.
    Functional:         printSquares with lambda.
    Metaprogramming:    constexpr factorial.
    Concurrency:        std::async + std::future.

“Multi-Paradigm Programming with Modern C++” means — one language, many paradigms, working together.
