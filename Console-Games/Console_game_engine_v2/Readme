/*

Here's a minimal working example of a console-based C++ game engine using ncurses on Linux. 
This code creates a simple moving character controlled with arrow keys.
This version introduces a clean architecture with core systems like Game, Entity, and Engine Loop separated.

This simple framework gives you:
    A working game loop (input → update → render)
    FPS limiting
    Input handling
    Rendering with ncurses

This is a scalable foundation. 
From here you can:
    Add more entities or enemies
    Build a map system
    Implement simple AI or turn-based logic
    Create a component system

eg. roguelike framework (tilemap, combat, levels, etc.) 

Essential dependencies:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential cmake libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev gdb valgrind
