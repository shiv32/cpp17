This Dungeon Crawler is a simple C++17 console-based rogue-like game. 
You control a player navigating a grid-based dungeon filled with enemies. 
The key features include:

        Player movement using keyboard input.
        Enemies with behavior patterns (like chasing the player).
        Turn-based logic where each entity (player/enemy) acts in a game loop.
        Polymorphism & smart pointers to manage actors.
        Design patterns like Strategy (for enemy AI), and Singleton (for the game engine).

It's a small CLI game to explore OOP and game loop design in C++.
