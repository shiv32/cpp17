Minimal C++ Game Engine Structure (Console-based)

Here’s a minimal example of a game engine structure in standard C++,
using just the STL and no external libraries — perfect as a foundation
for a console-based or text-mode game, or to expand later with graphics, input, etc.


This structure focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:
    Game loop
    Entity abstraction
    Update/draw cycle
    Input handling (basic)

Features You Can Add Next
    Basic input manager
    Collision system
    Component-based architecture (ECS)
    Time step and FPS handling
    Graphics via SFML, SDL, or NCurses
