ðŸŽ¯ Mini Project: UnrealConsoleSim

A simplified simulation of Unreal Engine using design patterns, 
all in the console (CLI), with the following features:

    Actors and Components (Composite Pattern)
    Game Loop (Template Method)
    Input Command System (Command Pattern)
    Event System (Observer Pattern)
    Actor Factory (Factory Method Pattern)
    Global Engine Instance (Singleton Pattern)


Game "UnrealConsoleSim" is a console-based simulation inspired by Unreal Engine's architecture, written in C++17.

ðŸŽ® Game Summary (Short):
A text-based simulation where you control and update Actor objects (like a hero) in a simple game world. 
Each Actor has a Tick() method that updates its state per frame, mimicking Unreal Engineâ€™s game loop.
