Basic CLI-based "Shooter Game Loop" inspired by Unreal Engine concepts.

ðŸŽ¯ Simulation Goal
    Create a text-based shooter prototype in console using C++. This includes:
        Player with health and ammo
        Enemy with health
        Game loop
        Actions: Shoot, Reload, Exit
        Simulate ticking like Unreal's Tick()
        Uses OOP (like UE Actor/Component system)

âœ… Design Patterns Used
        Pattern	        Purpose
        Command	        Encapsulate user actions (Shoot, Reload, Quit)
        Strategy	    Plug in enemy behaviors dynamically
        Observer	    Notify game state (e.g., death events)
        Singleton	    Manage global game state
        Factory	        Create commands dynamically based on input

ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Happening Behind the Scenes?
        Design Pattern	    Where It's Used
        Singleton	        GameManager handles global state and notifications
        Command	                All user actions are encapsulated as command objects
        Strategy	        Enemy behavior is easily swappable via EnemyStrategy
        Observer	        ConsoleNotifier observes and reacts to game events
        Factory	                CommandFactory builds commands dynamically by input

Future work:
    Score system.
    Weapon switching (more Strategy).
    Game save/load with Memento or Prototype patterns.
