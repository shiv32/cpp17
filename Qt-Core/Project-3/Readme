Qt State Machine
    The State Machine framework provides classes for creating and executing state graphs.

ðŸ”„ What is a State Graph?
    A state graph is a visual or logical representation of:

    Nodes = states (e.g., Idle, Running, Stopped)
    Edges = transitions between states, triggered by events (e.g., Start, Stop)
