## ‚öîÔ∏è Qt Widgets vs QML (Qt Quick)

| Feature                  | **Qt Widgets**                                | **Qt QML / Qt Quick**                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**              | Traditional, native-looking desktop UIs       | Modern, animated, fluid UIs (mobile & embedded)        |
| **Technology Base**      | C++ (imperative, event-driven)                | JavaScript + QML (declarative, GPU-rendered)           |
| **Rendering Engine**     | CPU-based (raster paint engine)               | GPU-based (scene graph, OpenGL / Vulkan)               |
| **Performance**          | Fast for static UIs, low CPU usage            | Smooth animations, better for visual effects           |
| **Look & Feel**          | Native desktop widgets (buttons, menus, etc.) | Custom-styled, flexible components                     |
| **Ease of Design**       | Designed via Qt Designer (`.ui` files)        | Designed via Qt Design Studio or QML files             |
| **Coding Style**         | C++ imperative code                           | Declarative QML + JS logic + C++ backend               |
| **Integration with C++** | Direct (widgets are C++ classes)              | Through C++ bindings (`QQmlContext`, `QObject`)        |
| **Animation Support**    | Basic (QPropertyAnimation)                    | Built-in, fluid animations (`Behavior`, `Transitions`) |
| **Mobile Support**       | Limited / Not ideal                           | Excellent (Android, iOS, embedded touch)               |
| **Theming / Styling**    | Uses native OS style or QStyle                | Full custom design via QML                             |
| **Memory Usage**         | Lower                                         | Higher (because of QML engine + scene graph)           |
| **Learning Curve**       | Easy for C++ devs                             | Easy for web devs / designers                          |
| **Tooling**              | Qt Designer (for `.ui`)                       | Qt Design Studio (for `.qml`)                          |
| **Examples of Use**      | Qt Creator, Wireshark, FreeCAD, Maya          | Automotive HMIs, mobile apps, kiosks, dashboards       |
| **Best For**             | Desktop utilities, IDEs, control panels       | Modern UIs, touchscreens, animations                   |
