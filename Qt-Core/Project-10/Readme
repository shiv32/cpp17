Project: Task Timer CLI
    A command-line tool that lets you start, stop, and track durations for 
    tasks (like a Pomodoro timer or work tracker).

Features
    Start a named task and track the time.
    Stop a running task.
    Show all tasks and their durations.
    Persist task logs in a local file (tasks.json or .txt).
    Optional: Add a timer notification after X minutes.

Ideas to Extend
    Save and load active task states across sessions.
    Use JSON for data structure.
    Show total time per task.
    Auto-stop with timeout (like Pomodoro).
    Add remove or rename commands.

Use case:
./TaskTimer start writing
./TaskTimer stop writing
./TaskTimer list
