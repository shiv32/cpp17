Qt Widgets vs QML

---

## 🧱 Qt Widgets — Still Used or Outdated?

### ✅ **Still Used in Industry (and Actively Maintained)**

Qt **Widgets** are **not outdated** — they’re **still widely used** in professional desktop applications.
They are part of Qt’s **core module** and still maintained by **The Qt Company**.

Qt Widgets are ideal for:

* Traditional **desktop UIs** (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* **Industrial tools**, dashboards, and control panels
* **Engineering and scientific** applications
* **Embedded systems** with simple UIs (no GPU-heavy animation)

---

### 🧰 Examples of Real-World Use

Many large and niche products use **Qt Widgets**:

* **Autodesk Maya**, **VirtualBox**, **Wireshark**, **Qt Creator IDE**, **FreeCAD**, **Krita**
* **Automotive and medical device UIs**
* Many **internal enterprise tools** and **embedded GUIs**

### 🚀 When NOT to Use Qt Widgets

If you want:

* **Modern mobile-style UI** (animations, fluid transitions, touch-friendly)
* **Cross-platform mobile + desktop** in one codebase
  → Then **QML / Qt Quick** is preferred.

Widgets are **pixel-based and static**, while **QML** is **scene-graph (GPU)-based**, allowing rich graphics.

### ⚖️ Summary

| Use Case                                            | Recommended UI                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Classic desktop apps (tools, IDEs, internal apps)   | **Qt Widgets** ✅               |
| Modern animated UIs, mobile apps, HMI, touchscreens | **QML / Qt Quick** ✅           |
| Embedded low-resource device                        | **Qt Widgets (lightweight)** ✅ |
| Mixed (Widgets + QML hybrid)                        | **Possible but complex** ⚠️    |

### 💡 Developer Tip

If you’re building **C++-centric** apps (not UI-heavy), Qt Widgets are perfect —
stable, fast, easy to integrate with backend C++ logic, and have long-term support.
