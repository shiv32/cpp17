/*

Thread with Member Function
        You can specify a member function of a class to be executed in a thread.

        With this technique, you are executing a method on a specific object in a separate thread. 
        If other threads are accessing the same object, you need to make sure this happens in a 
        thread-safe way to avoid data races.
        Mutual exclusion, can be used as a synchronization mechanism to make it thread-safe.
