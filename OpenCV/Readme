OpenCV is an open-source, cross-platform C++ computer vision and image processing library.
It provides optimized algorithms for image processing, video analysis, object detection, 
and machine learning, and is widely used in real-time systems.

OpenCV is a C++-based computer vision library with bindings for Python, Java, and other languages.
OpenCV is CPU-based by default and becomes GPU-accelerated only when explicitly built and used with CUDA or OpenCL APIs.
-----------------------------------
👉 Qt does NOT replace OpenCV
👉 Qt replaces Python / Java GUI frameworks

So the real comparison is:
	C++ + OpenCV (engine)
	C++ + Qt (UI + system glue)

Camera → OpenCV (processing) → Qt (display + controls)
-----------------------
OpenCV = vision engine
Qt = UI layer
-----------------------
OpenCV as a Console App

Very common in C++.
	Examples:
		Batch image processing
		Video analysis from files
		Image format conversion
		Face detection on stored images
		CCTV backend processing
		ML inference pipelines
---------------------------------
eg.
    ./vision_app input.jpg output.jpg

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        cv::Mat img = cv::imread("img.jpg");
        cv::Mat gray;
        cv::cvtColor(img, gray, cv::COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
        cv::imwrite("out.jpg", gray);
    }

No window, no mouse, no GUI.
----------------------------------------
Headless OpenCV (real-world usage)

In production systems:
	No monitor
	No keyboard
	Runs as a service

Used in:
	Traffic cameras
	Surveillance servers
	Factory inspection systems
	Robotics pipelines
	Cloud vision services

This is pure console / service mode.
--------------------------------------------
Why HFT does NOT use OpenCV

HFT (High-Frequency Trading) is about:
	Nanoseconds / microseconds latency
	Deterministic execution
	Zero unnecessary dependencies

OpenCV is for computer vision:
	Images, video, frames
	Heavy memory usage
	CPU/GPU intensive
	Not latency-deterministic

➡️ There is no image/video data in HFT
➡️ So OpenCV has no role.
