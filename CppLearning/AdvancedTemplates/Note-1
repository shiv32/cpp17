Templates & Template Metaprogramming

Templates (Normal Templates)
    Templates are a compile-time code generation mechanism.
        “Write once, generate type-specific code.”
    They are mainly about generic programming.

Template Metaprogramming (TMP)
    Template Metaprogramming is using templates as a programming language that runs at compile time.
        “Compute values, make decisions, and enforce rules at compile time.”

Real-World Analogy
    Templates: Blueprint
        “This works for any type.”

    Template Metaprogramming: Compile-time brain
        “Decide, calculate, and validate before the program exists.”

Use Templates when:
    ✔ You want generic containers
    ✔ You want reusable algorithms
    ✔ You want zero-cost abstractions

Use TMP when:
    ✔ You want compile-time validation
    ✔ You want to remove runtime branches
    ✔ You want static configuration systems
    ✔ You build frameworks / engines / libraries

One-Line Difference (Exam / Interview)
                   Templates = generic code generation
    Template metaprogramming = compile-time programming using templates
