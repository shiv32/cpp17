VARIADIC TEMPLATES
    Variadic templates can take a variable number of template parameters.

    NOTE 
        The three dots following typename are not an error. 
        This is the syntax to define a parameter pack for variadic templates. 
        A parameter pack is something that can accept a variable number of arguments. 
        You are allowed to put spaces before and after the three dots.
