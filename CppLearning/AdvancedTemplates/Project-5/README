EMULATING FUNCTION PARTIAL SPECIALIZATION WITH OVERLOADING
  The C++ standard does not permit partial template specialization of functions. 
  Instead, you can overload the function with another template. 

  NOTE 
    Between all overloaded versions, function template specializations, and
    specific function template instantiations, the compiler always chooses the 
    “most specific” one to call. 
    If a non-template version is just as specific as a function template instantiation, 
    then the compiler prefers the non-template version.
