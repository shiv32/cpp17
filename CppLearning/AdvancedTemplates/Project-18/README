Using enable_if
    The use of enable_if is based on a feature called Substitution Failure Is Not An Error (SFINAE),
    a complicated feature of C++.

    WARNING 
        Relying on SFINAE is tricky and complicated. 
        If your use of SFINAE and enable_if selectively disables the wrong overloads in your overload set, 
        you will get cryptic compiler errors, which will be hard to track down.
