METAPROGRAMMING
    The goal of template metaprogramming is to perform some computation at compile time instead of at run time. 
    It is basically a programming language on top of C++.

Factorial at Compile Time

    NOTE 
        It is important to keep in mind that the factorial calculation is happening at compile time. 
        At run time, you simply access the compile-time calculated value through ::val, 
        which is just a static constant value.
