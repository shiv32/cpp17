Adaptor Function Objects
    The adaptors provide a modicum of support for functional composition, that is, 
    to combine functions together to create the exact behavior you need.

Binders
    Binders can be used to bind parameters of callables to certain values.

    WARNING
        Before C++11 there was bind2nd() and bind1st(). 
        Both are deprecated since C++11, and are actually removed from the C++17 standard. 
        Use lambda expressions or bind() instead.
