Negators
    not_fn
        Negators are similar to binders but they complement the result of a callable.
        
    not1 and not2

    NOTE
        not1() and not2() have been deprecated by the C++17 standard. 
        Both unary_function and binary_function are deprecated since C++11, 
        and are officially removed from C++17. 
        You should avoid using any of this functionality in new code.
