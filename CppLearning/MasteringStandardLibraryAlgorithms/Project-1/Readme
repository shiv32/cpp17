OVERVIEW OF ALGORITHMS

The find and find_if Algorithms
    find() looks for a specific element in an iterator range.

    WARNING
        If find() fails to find an element, 
        it returns an iterator equal to the end iterator specified in the function call, 
        not the end iterator of the underlying container.

        If a container provides a method with the same functionality as a generic algorithm, 
        you should use the method instead, because it’s faster. 
        For example, the generic find() algorithm runs in linear time, even on a map, 
        while the find() method on a map runs in logarithmic time.

    find_if() is similar to find(), except that it accepts a predicate function callback instead of a simple element to match.
