Calling Member Functions
    If you have a container of objects, 
    you sometimes want to pass a pointer to a class method as the callback to an algorithm.

Invokers
    Call any callable object with a set of parameters.
    It is very useful in templated code where you need to invoke some arbitrary callable object.
