FUNCTION OBJECTS
    You can overload the function call operator in a class such that objects of the class can be used in place of function pointers. 
    These objects are called function objects, or just functors.
    C++ provides several predefined functor classes, 
    defined in the <functional> header file, 
    that perform the most commonly used callback operations.

    Note
        It is recommended to use lambda expressions, 
        if possible, instead of small function objects because lambda expressions are easier to use, read, and understand.

Arithmetic Function Objects

    Warning
        The arithmetic function objects are just wrappers around the arithmetic operators. 
        If you use the function objects as callbacks in algorithms, 
        make sure that the objects in your container implement the appropriate operation, 
        such as operator* or operator+.

Transparent Operator Functors
    Note
        It’s recommended to always use the transparent operator functors.

Comparison Function Objects

Logical Function Objects
    Note
    The allTrue() and anyTrue() functions are just given as examples. 
    In fact, the Standard Library provides the std::all_of() and any_of() algorithms 
    that perform the same operations, but that have the benefit of short-circuiting, 
    so they are more performant.

Bitwise Function Objects
