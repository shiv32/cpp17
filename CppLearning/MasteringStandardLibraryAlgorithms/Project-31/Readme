Scan Algorithms
    You “scan” through the data once, from beginning to end, carrying state (the total).

    Inclusive scan: Includes the current element.

                    out[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i]

        
                    input : [1, 2, 3, 4]
                    output: [1, 3, 6, 10]

    Exclusive scan: Excludes the current element.
    
                    out[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]


                    input : [1, 2, 3, 4]
                    output: [0, 1, 3, 6]
