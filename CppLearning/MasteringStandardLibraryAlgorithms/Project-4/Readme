LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS
    Lambda expressions allow you to write anonymous functions inline, 
    removing the need to write a separate function or a function object.

    Note
        When using a capture default, 
        only those variables that are really used in the body of the lambda expression are captured, 
        either by value (=) or by reference (&). 
        Unused variables are not captured.
    
    WARNING
        It is not recommended to use a capture default, 
        even though a capture default only captures those variables that are really used in the body of the lambda expression. 
        By using a = capture default, you might accidentally cause an expensive copy. 
        By using an & capture default, you might accidentally modify a variable in the enclosing scope. 
        I recommend to explicitly specify which variables you want to capture.
