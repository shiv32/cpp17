    The derived class knowledge characteristic is not true for non-pointer or non-reference objects. You
    can cast or assign a Derived to a Base because a Derived is a Base. However, the object loses any
    knowledge of the derived class at that point.

    NOTE:   Derived classes retain their overridden methods when referred to by base
            class pointers or references. 
            They lose their uniqueness when cast to a base class object. 
            The loss of the derived classâ€™s data members and overridden methods is called slicing.
