```cpp
out.data() + out.size()
```

actually means in C++.

---

## 🧩 Suppose you have:

```cpp
std::string out(10, ' ');
```

### 1️⃣ `out.data()`

* Returns a **pointer** to the first character in the string’s internal buffer.
* Type: `char*` (since C++17 it’s non-const and writable).
* Think of it as:

  ```
  &out[0]
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ `out.size()`

* Returns the **number of characters** in the string (`10` in this case).

---

### 3️⃣ `out.data() + out.size()`

* That’s **pointer arithmetic**.
* It moves the pointer forward by `out.size()` bytes (10 chars here).

So if:

```
out.data() ---> points to the first char
out.data() + 1 ---> points to the second char
out.data() + out.size() ---> points just **past the last char**
```

This pointer is called a **one-past-the-end** iterator — valid for comparison but **not dereference**.

---

### 🧠 Why it’s used in `std::to_chars`

The function:

```cpp
std::to_chars(char* first, char* last, int value);
```

writes characters in the range `[first, last)` — meaning:

* It can write **up to but not including** `last`.
* `last` (the end pointer) ensures we don’t overflow the buffer.

So:

```cpp
std::to_chars(out.data(), out.data() + out.size(), 12345);
```

→ writes digits `"12345"` safely inside the `out` buffer (max 10 chars).

### ✅ Summary

| Expression                | Meaning                    | Type          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| `out.data()`              | Pointer to first char      | `char*`       |
| `out.size()`              | Number of chars            | `std::size_t` |
| `out.data() + out.size()` | Pointer one past last char | `char*`       |
