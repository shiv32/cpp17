ORDERED ASSOCIATIVE CONTAINERS
    Unlike the sequential containers, the ordered associative containers do not store elements in a linear
    configuration. 
    Instead, they provide a mapping of keys to values. 

Four ordered associative containers
    map, multimap, set, and multiset

Four unordered associative containers
    unordered_map, unordered_multimap, unordered_set, and unordered_multiset

The pair Utility Class
    pair is a class template that groups together two values of possibly different types.
    Defined in the <utility> header file.
