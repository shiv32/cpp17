map

map Iterators
    iterators refer to key/value pairs instead of just the values.

WARNING 
    You can modify element values through non- const iterators,
    but the compiler will generate an error if you try to modify the key of an element,
    even through a non- const iterator, because it would destroy the sorted order of
    the elements in the map.
