set
    A set, defined in <set>, is very similar to a map.
    In sets the key is the value. 
    sets are useful for storing information in which there is no explicit key, 
    but which you want to have in sorted order without any duplicates, with quick insertion, lookup, and deletion.

set Example: Access Control List
    One way to implement basic security on a computer system is through access control lists. 
    A set provides a nice way to represent the access control list.

multiset
    A multiset is to a set what a multimap is to a map.
    It allows multiple elements that are equal to each other to be stored in the container simultaneously.
