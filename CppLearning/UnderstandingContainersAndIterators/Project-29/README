Inserting Elements

    NOTE 
    
        map and the other ordered associative containers do provide a version of insert() that takes an iterator position. 
        However, that position is only a “hint” to the container as to the correct position. 
        The container is not required to insert the element at that position.

    The insert() Method

        The insert() method can be used to add elements to a map, and has the advantage of allowing
        you to detect if a key already exists. 
        insert() does not overwrite an element value if one already exists with the specified key. 

    The insert_or_assign() Method

        insert_or_assign() has a similar return type as insert(). 
        insert_or_assign() overwrites the old value with the new value.
