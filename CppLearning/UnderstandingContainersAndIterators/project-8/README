/*

Accessing Fields of Object Elements
    If the elements of your container are objects, you can use the -> operator on iterators to call methods 
    or access data members of those objects. 

    For example, the following program creates a vector of ten strings, then iterates over all of them appending 
    a new string to each one.

        vector<string> stringVector(10, "hello");
        
        for (auto it = begin(stringVector); it != end(stringVector); ++it) 
        {
            it->append(" shiv");
        }

    Often, using a range-based for loop results in more elegant code.

        vector<string> stringVector(10, "hello");

        for (auto& str : stringVector) 
        {
            str.append(" shiv");
        }
