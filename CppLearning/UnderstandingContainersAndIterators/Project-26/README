stack
    A stack is almost identical to a queue, except that it provides first-in, last-out (FILO) semantics,
    also known as last-in, first-out (LIFO), instead of FIFO. 

        template <class T, class Container = deque<T>> class stack;

stack Operations

    WARNING 
        pop() does not return the element popped. 
        If you want to retain a copy, you must first retrieve it with top().

stack Example: Revised Error Correlator
    You can rewrite the ErrorCorrelator class so that it gives out the most recent error
    instead of the one with the highest priority. 
    The only change required is to change mErrors from a priority_queue to a stack.
