UNORDERED ASSOCIATIVE CONTAINERS OR HASH TABLES

    unordered_map, 
    unordered_multimap, 
    unordered_set,
    unordered_multiset.

The map, multimap, set, and multiset containers sort their elements, 
while these unordered variants do not sort their elements.

Hash Functions
    The unordered associative containers are also called hash tables. 
    That is because the implementation makes use of so-called hash functions.

Project 
    Code demonstrates how to write a custom hash function. 
    This implementation simply forwards the request to one of the available standard hash functions.
    operator== compares the wrapped integers.
    std::hash<IntWrapper> uses std::hash<int> internally to hash the wrapped value.
    Now unordered_set and unordered_map can store and find IntWrapper objects correctly.
