CONTAINER ADAPTORS
  In addition to the standard sequential containers, 
  the Standard Library provides three container adaptors: queue, priority_queue, and stack. 
  Each of these adaptors is a wrapper around one of the sequential containers.

  queue
    The queue container adaptor, defined in the header file <queue>, 
    provides standard “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) semantics. 

      template <class T, class Container = deque<T>> class queue;

  queue Operations
    
    WARNING 
      pop() does not return the element popped. 
      If you want to retain a copy, you must first retrieve it with front().

  queue Example: A Network Packet Buffer
    When two computers communicate over a network, they send information to each other divided up into discrete chunks called packets. 
    The packets should be processed in the order they arrive, so this problem is perfect for a queue structure.
