unordered_map
    The unordered_map container is defined in <unordered_map> as a class template.

unordered_map Example: Phone Book
    Example uses an unordered_map to represent a phone book.
    
unordered_multimap
    An unordered_multimap is an unordered_map that allows multiple elements with the same key.

    NOTE 
        unordered_multimaps allow you to insert identical key/value pairs. 
        If you want to avoid this redundancy, 
        you must check explicitly before inserting a new element.

unordered_set/unordered_multiset
    The <unordered_set> header file defines unordered_set and unordered_multiset, 
    which are very similar to set and multiset, respectively, except that 
    they do not sort their keys but they use a hash function.
