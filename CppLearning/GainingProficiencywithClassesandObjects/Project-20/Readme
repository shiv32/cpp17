When the Copy Constructor Is Called

C++ string is actually a class, not a built-in type.

Whenever you pass an object to a function or method, 
the compiler calls the copy constructor of the new object to initialize it.

Example:
    The string copy constructor is executed for the inString object in printString() with name as its parameter.
    When the printString() method finishes, inString is destroyed. 
    Because it was only a copy of name, name remains intact.

g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o test
