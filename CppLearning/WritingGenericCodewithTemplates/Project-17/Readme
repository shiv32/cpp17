/*

Deriving from Class Templates
    You can inherit from class templates. 
    If the derived class inherits from the template itself, it must be a template as well.

Inheritance versus Specialization
    Derived classes contain all base class data members and methods.
    you must rewrite all required code in the specialization.

NOTE 
    Use inheritance for extending implementations and for polymorphism.
    Use specialization for customizing implementations for particular types.
