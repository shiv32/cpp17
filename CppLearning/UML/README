UML 2 supports six different kinds of relationships between classes.

    1. Inheritance (A ──▷B)
        A derived class inherits from a base class, can override methods, and may add new functionality.

    2. Realization/Implementation (A - - - - - - - ▷B<<interface>>)
        A class implements an interface (abstract class).
        
    3. Aggregation (Weak Ownership) (A◇──── B)
        A class contains another class, but does not own it (objects can exist independently).
        The contained object can exist without the parent.
            eg. A Car has a Driver, but the Driver can exist without the Car.
    
    4. Composition(Strong Ownership) (A◆──── B)
        A class contains and owns another class. The contained object is destroyed with the parent.
            eg. A Human has a Heart, but the Heart cannot exist without the Human.

    5. Dependency (A - - - - > B)
        A class temporarily uses another class but does not own it permanently.

    6. Association (A ────── B)
        One class has a reference to another (e.g., composition, aggregation).
