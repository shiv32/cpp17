Let’s clearly differentiate **Dependency**, **Association**, **Aggregation**, and **Composition** in **C++**, 
since these are fundamental object-oriented relationship types often confused with each other 👇

---

## 🔹 1. **Dependency ("uses-a")**

A **temporary relationship** — one class **depends** on another *just to perform some task*.
It’s not stored as a member; it’s usually passed as a parameter or used locally.

### Example:

```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void start() { std::cout << "Engine started\n"; }
};

class Car {
public:
    void drive(Engine& engine) {  // uses Engine temporarily
        engine.start();
        std::cout << "Car is driving\n";
    }
};
```

### Key points:

* Lifetime **not managed** by `Car`
* Exists only **during function call**
* Weakest relationship

🟩 **Type:** Dependency
🕒 **Lifetime:** Short-term (local or parameter)

---

## 🔹 2. **Association ("knows-a")**

A **long-term logical relationship** — one class **has a reference or pointer** to another, but does **not own** it.

### Example:

```cpp
class Driver {
    std::string name;
public:
    Driver(std::string n) : name(n) {}
    void drive() { std::cout << name << " is driving\n"; }
};

class Car {
    Driver* driver;  // associated but not owned
public:
    Car(Driver* d) : driver(d) {}
    void startTrip() { driver->drive(); }
};
```

### Key points:

* `Car` **knows** a `Driver`
* `Car` doesn’t control driver’s lifetime
* Bidirectional association is also possible

🟩 **Type:** Association
🕒 **Lifetime:** Independent

---

## 🔹 3. **Aggregation ("has-a")**

A **“whole–part”** relationship — the *whole* has *parts*, but parts **can exist independently**.

### Example:

```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void start() { std::cout << "Engine started\n"; }
};

class Car {
    Engine* engine;  // owned reference, but engine can exist outside
public:
    Car(Engine* e) : engine(e) {}
    void start() { engine->start(); }
};
```

### Key points:

* Engine can exist **before or after** Car
* Car **uses** Engine but **doesn’t delete** it
* Represented by a **hollow diamond** in UML

🟩 **Type:** Aggregation
🕒 **Lifetime:** Shared (no ownership)

---

## 🔹 4. **Composition ("owns-a")**

A **strong form of aggregation** — the *whole* **owns** the *part*, and destroys it when destroyed.

### Example:

```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void start() { std::cout << "Engine started\n"; }
};

class Car {
    Engine engine;  // Car owns Engine
public:
    void start() { engine.start(); }
};
```

### Key points:

* Engine’s lifetime **tied to Car**
* Automatically constructed/destructed with Car
* Represented by a **filled diamond** in UML

🟩 **Type:** Composition
🕒 **Lifetime:** Same (ownership)

## 🔸 Summary Table

| Relationship    | Description          | Member Type         | Ownership | Lifetime    |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **Dependency**  | Uses temporarily     | Local var / param   | ❌         | Short       |
| **Association** | Knows another object | Pointer / reference | ❌         | Independent |
| **Aggregation** | Whole-part (shared)  | Pointer / reference | ⚪ Partial | Shared      |
| **Composition** | Whole-part (owned)   | Direct member       | ✅         | Same        |
