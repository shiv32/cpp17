Composition vs Aggregation vs Association

Composition – strong ownership
Aggregation – shared but independent ownership
Association – no ownership, just usage

Composition	    Car → Engine	    Strong (Car owns Engine)	    Engine destroyed with Car
Aggregation	    Driver → Car	    Weak (Driver uses Car)	        Car can outlive Driver
Association	    Mechanic → Car	    No ownership	                Independent objects
