A shared_ptr support so-called aliasing.

    Aliasing allows a std::shared_ptr to share ownership of one object 
    while pointing to a different (related) object.

    One control block, different pointer.


Sometimes you want:

    Shared ownership of a whole object
    But access only to a subobject (member, element, base class)

Without aliasing, you’d risk:

    Double deletion
    Dangling pointers
    Incorrect ownership

Aliasing solves this safely.

Quick rule of thumb
    Need shared ownership? → shared_ptr
    Need to point to part of owned object? → aliasing
    Need sole ownership? → unique_ptr
