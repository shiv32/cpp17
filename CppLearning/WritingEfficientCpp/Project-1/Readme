PROFILING
Profiling Example with gprof
First Design Attempt

    There are three steps to using gprof:

1.  Compile your program with a special flag that causes it to log raw execution information
    when it is run. 
    When using g++ as your compiler, the flag is â€“pg, as in this example:

        $ g++ -std=c++17 -pg -o namedb NameDB.cpp main.cpp

2.  Run your program. 

       $ ./namedb

    This should generate a file called gmon.out in the working directory. 
    Be patient when you run the program because this first version is slow.

3.  Run the gprof command. 
    This final step enables you to analyze the gmon.out profiling information and produce a (somewhat) readable report. 
    gprof outputs to standard out, so you should redirect the output to a file:
    
        $ gprof namedb gmon.out > gprof_analysis.out

4. open file gprof_analysis.out in text editor.
