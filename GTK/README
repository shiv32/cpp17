GTK (GIMP Toolkit)
    Originally developed for the GIMP image editor (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
    Now a general-purpose GUI toolkit for building graphical Linux/Unix applications
    Written in C using GObject for object-oriented programming

gtkmm
    GTK + mm, where mm stands for "C++ bindings" (by C++ naming convention)
    The "mm" naming comes from the convention for C++ wrappers (like glibmm, cairomm, sigc++)
    gtkmm is the official C++ interface to GTK
    gtkmm is the official C++ binding for the GTK (GIMP Toolkit), 
    allowing developers to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using C++ in an object-oriented way.
    gtkmm is the official C++ wrapper for GTK
    it provides an idiomatic, object-oriented C++ API over GTK (GObject).
    
Key Features
    C++ wrapper for GTK (written in C)
    Fully object-oriented, uses C++ classes, signals, and inheritance
    Follows standard C++ idioms (RAII, STL)
    Provides classes for:
        Windows, Buttons, Labels, Menus
        Layouts, Dialogs, Events, Custom widgets

Advantages
    Native C++ syntax (vs GObject macros in C)
    Safer and cleaner code (RAII)
    Actively maintained

Limitations
    Heavier than plain GTK (due to C++ abstraction)

Install on Manjaro/Arch Linux
    sudo pacman -S gtkmm3

Compile and run
    g++ main.cpp -o app `pkg-config gtkmm-3.0 --cflags --libs` && ./app && rm app
